Here's a Ruby on Rails app that will shorten any URL and give you a new link to copy and share. Future plans for this app is account for what if a URL does not exist, have the domain name be shorter, and styling. 


User Story

    As a user I should be able to enter a url in a form and receive a shortened url as an integer(id)
    When visiting this shortened url I should be redirected to the original url

Example:
- Given a ‘long’ url in the form (https://twitter.com/jciancio7), should generate a shortened url (https://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/3)
- When I visit https://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/3, I should be redirected to https://twitter.com/jciancio7
Bonus

Instead of just receiving an integer
- As a user I should be able to enter a url in a form and receive a shortened url as a random string
- When visiting this shortened url I should be redirected to the original url

Example:
- Given a 'long’ url (https://twitter.com/jciancio7), should generate a shortened url (https://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/asdf)
- When I visit https://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/asdf, I should be redirected to https://twitter.com/jciancio7
NOTE: Check for uniqueness so that you don’t create duplicate shortened urls
Bonus 2

    As a user I should be able to pass a url as a paramater and receive a shortened url as a random string
    When visiting this shortened url I should be redirected to the original url

Example:
- Visitng https://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/https://twitter.com/jciancio7, should return a shortened url (https://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/asdf)
- Visitng https://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/asdf I should be redirected to https://twitter.com/jciancio7
